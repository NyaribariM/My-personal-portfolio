When you open the site to my personal portfolio, you will be welcomed by an interactive guessing game.
You will be required to guess the secret baking ingredient.
If the answer is correct, you will be permitted into the home page of the portfolio.
If the answer is wrong, you will be prompted to attempt another answer.
The secret ingredient is a random choice among the following: flour, sugar, butter and cinnamon.
After getting past the fun game, there will be icons at the top of the page.
The clickable icons are for the following pages: home, about, projects and contacts.
After viewing all the necessary credentials in my portfolio from all the above named pages, you will b able to contact me by sending a message.
Otherwise, you can contact through other socials, such as: linkedin and instagram.
You can also check out my github account for my publicly displayed projects. 
All the contacts above are linked in the footer of the contacts page.
I hope to impress you, my visitor, with my portfolio page.
