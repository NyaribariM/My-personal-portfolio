          The website is for a restaurant called Masafa Food Palace. This is my first Project
          in which i learnt everything about web development. I was mostly captivated by the 
          development of this website and hence I chose to specialise in Web development and 
          design.

          In order to launch one's career as a Software Engineer, one way to start is by 
          creating a profile card. It is important as it is used to obtain one's clients.
          Therfore, I made it possible for people to access my services in Web development 
          and design by posting my detils on the internet. Through my profile card, potential 
          clients find a way to contact me.
