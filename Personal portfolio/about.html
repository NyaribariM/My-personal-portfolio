    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I got involved in Software Engineering while doing an 8-week online course by
      Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology(JKUAT). The course inspired 
      great interest in Software Engineering which steered me to pursue a life-long 
      career in it. I am also greatly inspired to invent technology essential to young
      people just like me and others; to create something that will meet all our points 
      of need. 
      I take pride in my role as a young lady in Software Engineering to encourage other 
      women to look into the same.

      Personally, as a lady who loves fashion, I struggle with my outfits sometimes.
      I used to wish for a site that would advise me on my choice of clothing and 
      accessories when I an unsure. When I ventured into Web development, I decided 
      to become the change I and other women worlwide needed. I developed a website 
      called "The Fashion Advisor" which would come to solve my fashion problems!
